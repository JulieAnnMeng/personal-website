        <p>
            After graduating the University of Centeral Florida, Julie began working as an Event Coordinator.
            She planned many public events, both small and large in scale.
            After several years, she found herself wanting to do something more with her life, dealing with upset event guests was not as fulfilling as she had hoped.  
            She quit her job and began her search for a new career.
